limitation.  This style was created by Trappist Monks in Belgium over 500 years ago. To be true to the style, Merry Monks' Ale is bottle conditioned. This means we add a bit of sugar and yeast just prior to bottling. This imparts a special effervescence to the beer, a creamier carbonation, and also extends the shelf life. The on-going fermentation inside the bottle will change the character of the beer as it ages, and you'll find it becomes dryer with age. You may want to lay down a few bottles for future evaluation. We suggest storing at cellar temperatures -around 55 degrees F- and away from light.\n\n\nWhen you try this beer you're in for a unique treat. The special effervescence and creaminess are immediately apparent when pouring. The Pilsner malts combined with the Belgian yeast strains  yield a remarkable and complex flavor- perhaps you'll note subtle hints of fruit or spice. The flavor is nicely balanced and the finish moderate to dry , begging for the next sip.\n\n\nYou might ask why we go through all this trouble and expense for just a beer, but one taste and you'll know the Merry Monks' Ale (9.3% ABV) will more than complement any meal it accompanies. Enjoyed best around 48 degrees F, it also makes a fine after-dinner drink.","ibu":31,"name":"Merry Monks","state":"Pennsylvania","website":"http://www.weyerbacher.com/"},{"abv":5,"address":"150 Simcoe Street","category":"North American Ale","city":"London","coordinates":[42.9778,-81.2467],"country":"Canada","description":"John and Hugh Labatt, grandsons of founder John K.

It is derived from bitter ales but contains even more alcohol and hops. This helped preserve the beer on its long sea journey around Cape Hope to India.\n\n\nBritish troops returning from India brought their love of this beer back with them so breweries began brewing it for the home market as well. Sadly, the style had mostly died out in England by the late twentieth century.\n\n\nAmerican home brewers began to brew I.P.A. because of their love for the intense hoppiness of the style. In time American I.P.A.s became much more aggressively bitter and hoppy than their historical predecessors.\n\n\nBig Eye I.P.A. is our version of this wonderful style.  American Centennial hops are  used exclusively to bitter, flavor, finish, and dry hop the Big Eye.

The exclusive use of two row barley not only imparts a full, smooth body but also gives the beer a wide spectrum of malt flavor ranging from slightly sweet to caramel to slightly roasted. The Noble hops varieties, Hallertau Mittelfruh and Tettnang Tettnanger, add a wide range of floral, piney and citrus notes, which are present from the aroma, through the flavor, to the lingering smooth finish.

Perhaps UFOâ€™s initial sensory perception is also its most prominent: a cloudy golden color and a dense, frothy head.  The yeast, which has not been filtered out, accounts for the cloudiness of UFO.  Wheat malt tends to create a larger head than barley malt, the cereal grain most often used in brewing.  When served in a traditional wheat beer glass with a lemon, UFO presents an appealing and distinctive visual image.\n\n\nThe aroma has a faint but clear citrus-like character.  This is produced by the special yeast and accounts for the Bavarian tradition of serving hefeweizens with a lemon.  The lemon accentuates the yeastâ€™s fruity, tart fragrance.  UFO has a soft mouthfeel and a refreshing, light body.  The wheat malts and subtle hopping give the beer a mild, delicate flavor.  UFO has a clean finish.

The oats were blended with the best barley malt we have â€“ and we didnâ€™t stop there.  To give this beer a wonderful roasted flavor, we added unmalted, very darkly roasted barley.  The roasted barley is mixed with a generous portion of chocolate colored malt giving the Blast Furnace Stout a beautiful ruby hue.\n\n\nWe used our finest hops unsparingly to create a delicately balanced bitterness with a rich roastiness and fresh hop aroma. The Fuggles and East Kent Goldings hops were added with heavy hands at two different times.  This unbridled addition grants a full hop flavor to our heavenly drink.\n\n\nA typical oatmeal stout is a bit lower in alcohol than most other stouts as does the Blast Furnace Stout.

We pick the hops ourselves and then take them directly to the brew kettle, without being dried, just after picking so they retain nearly all of their natural oils and resins. It is made with Cascade, Centennial and Chinook hops. Until now, this beer has only been available in draft. Starting this year, we will be bottling it on a very limited basis, with plans to expand its availability as we expand our Chico hop field in the coming years.","ibu":43,"name":"Chico Estate Harvest Ale","state":"California","website":"http://www.sierranevada.com/"},{"abv":4.5,"address":"701 Galveston Ave","category":"North American Ale","city":"Fortworth","coordinates":[32.7366,-97.3274],"country":"United States","description":"Rahr's Red is a delicious, medium-bodied red lager.

Our first brew of this light and refreshing beer was in the summer of 1984.\n\n\nAnchor Summer is an all-malt beer, and over 50% of its malt comes from malted wheat. It is fermented with a Triticum aestivum, AKA wheat traditional top-fermenting \"ale\" yeast because we prefer the clean flavors developed by this yeast. We believe that this style best celebrates the refreshingly light flavor of malted wheat. You may notice that the head on this beer is unusually abundant, with a consistency similar to whipped egg whites. This is due to protein contributed by the wheat.\n\n\nThe brewers at Anchor are proud to have revived not only rich hearty dark beers, but also this light crisp style of a modern American wheat beer.\n\n\nSummer getaway Wheat malt contributes to an unusual lightness and dryness to the palate, and thisâ€”combined with the distinctive flavor of the wheatâ€”makes for a perfect thirst-quenching beverage. It is the ideal drink for beer lovers who appreciate tradition and character in their beer, but also seek a lighter, refreshing style, perfect for warm weather.\n\n\n-http://www.anchorbrewing.com/beers/summerbeer.htm","ibu":96,"name":"Anchor Summer Beer","state":"California"},{"abv":7.8000001907000005,"address":"2401 Blake St.","category":"Irish Ale","city":"Denver","coordinates":[39.7582,-104.99],"country":"United States","description":"Gonzo Imperial Porter is deep and complex.

Because the ships had to cross the equator twice to get there, spoilage was a major problem until some clever brewer realized that both alcohol and hops are natural preservatives. James brews Hurricane I.P.A. in this tradition, and packs it with enough hops and alcohol to survive crossing the orbit of Mercury twice. The grist is 100% Gambrinus premium 2-row barley malt, copiously hopped with fresh Centennial and Willamette.

Often they arrive with a glazed look in their eyes, having endured days of office drudgery or the unknowable hardships of securing a parking spot. Set your cares aside, for all can find solace in this ale's yin-yang of nutty maltiness and delicate, dryish hoppiness. For our Nut Brown, an ale deep auburn in colour, we use a blend of Munich, caramel and chocolate malts to create a rich malty palate with a lingering dry chocolatiness.","ibu":30,"name":"Nirvana Nut Brown Ale","state":"British Columbia","website":"http://www.steamworks.com/gastown_index.htm"},{"abv":5.5,"address":"357 East Taylor Street","category":"German Ale","city":"San Jose","coordinates":[37.3526,-121.893],"country":"United States","ibu":1,"name":"Gordon Biersch Hefeweizen","state":"California","website":"http://www.gordonbiersch.com/brewery"},{"abv":5.9000000954,"address":"30 Butterfield Road","category":"Belgian and French Ale","city":"Warrenville","coordinates":[41.8206,-88.2068],"country":"United States","description":"Domaine DuPage is a rural, northern France, amber colored ale.

The style gets its name from the white, milky appearance of this unfiltered wheat ale. The brewers of Samuel AdamsÂ® beer, taking inspiration from the Belgians, have created a classic of their own. On the malt side, we use malted two row Pale barley, malted wheat, and Munich malt to give this beer a crisp, malty, cereal finish and smooth mouth feel. The hops used are Noble Tettnang Tettnanger hops. At the end of the kettle boil, we add a proprietary spice blend to give Samuel AdamsÂ® White Ale a unique and complex flavor, without being overpowering or cloying. The spice blend includes orange and lemon peel, dried plum, grains of paradise, coriander, anise, hibiscus, rose hips, tamarind, and vanilla. It is this special blend of spices that gives Samuel AdamsÂ® White Ale its unique character, complexity and refreshing drinkability. The beer is coarse filtered, leaving a white haze from the malt proteins.

The taste is highly complex- perhaps you'll even discern notes of espresso or chocolate. \n\n\nOld Heathen imperial stout is our interpretation of a beer style that originated in the 18th century. Brewed in England and exported to Germany, Scandinavia and Russia, these beers became fashionable among the members of the Czar's court. In order to survive long voyages they were brewed with high alcohol content to prevent spoilage. And at 8.0% ABV (alcohol by volume) Old Heathen definitely contains a warming belt. You may want to lay down a few bottles for future evaluation- this beer keeps well and will only get better with age.\n\n\nLike most of our beers, Weyerbacher Old Heathen is a perfect accompaniment to foods.

Our Black Rye Bock has a distinctive bitter chocolate palate and black color reminiscent of a black beer. The spiciness from the rye malt shines through in the flavor. The high alcohol balanced with malty sweetness rounds out this cold season bock.

This are was a part of the Netherlands in the early 1800's and was the wheat growing region. In this era, the Dutch basically controlled the spice trade, thus, coriander as well as Curacao orange peel made its way into the beer. Spices were used well before the widespread use of hops in beer. At one point there were more than thirty breweries producing a Wit, but overtime the style died off and in 1954 the last of the breweries ceased operations. One of the most famous brands of Belgian Wits is Hoegaarden (pronounced \"Who Garden\") produced by Pierre Celis back in 1966. This revived the style and by the 1980's it was popular again!\n\n\nBelgian Wits are similar to a Hefeweizen with respect to the cloudiness of the beer and some phenolic (clove) and tart flavors. Wits should have white, rocky head when poured and should be almost white in appearance, hence the name. \n\n\nYou will smell oranges and coriander which is different than a Hefeweizen that smells of banana and clove.

Our interpretation uses the highest-quality, floor-malted base malt, which lends a full-bodied and rich caramel flavor. We mash at high temperatures and add generous amounts of specialty malts to further emphasize a strong foundation of malt as leverage for our generous additions of hopsâ€¦ Which are indeed generous. We use a total of three different hop strains, and add a total of six different additions throughout the process. The Bengali Tiger has a hoppy snap upfront, but strides at a steady pace, and finishes balanced. The signature characteristic of the Tiger is the aromaâ€¦ we use massive quantities of whole East Kent Goldings hops to dry hop in our conditioning tanks. The result? The essential oils from the hops are an enticing treat before every sip.

He lost his life in 2002 while fighting a wild fire outside of Lyons, Colorado.\n\n\nOriginally our winter seasonal beer, it has become a cult favorite of extreme-beer lovers, so we now brew occasional batches of Gordon throughout the year. Released in bottles in 2003 and 2004, Gordon is now sold in four packs of hand-labeled cans and on draft in select markets.\n\n\n--http://www.oskarblues.com/brew/","ibu":62,"name":"Gordon","state":"Colorado","website":"http://www.oskarblues.com/"},{"abv":5,"address":"811 Edward Street","category":"Other Style","city":"Utica","coordinates":[43.1045,-75.2452],"country":"United States","description":"This Delicious Fruity ale is brewed with blackberries, raspberries and sweetened with a touch of blueberry honey.

Allay your fears my friends because Iâ€™m going to tell you.  A hefe weizen is a special style of beer made with malted wheat and malted barley.  Hefe weizens are from Germany.  This beer is top fermented (an ale) with a very special yeast.  The Hop levels are kept deliberately low in order to bring out the character of the yeast.  If you notice the nose of the beer, it has a clove-like or fruity aroma.  The grain bill includes 50% wheat malt and 50% barley malt.  It is served very carbonated and a touch cloudy.  It is cloudy because it is served unfiltered.

Distinct nuance and complexity are contributed by the wood's previous tenants, resulting in unique flavor profiles in each batch that continue to change over time.

It is a medium-bodied, malt-accented dark brew, very opaque and deep-sepia in color, with a chewy texture and a firm, creamy, long-lasting head. In spite of its dark color, it comes across as a soft and elegant brew that is rich, mild, and surprisingly balanced. It never tastes harsh, toasty or acrid. The beer is often referred to as a Schwarzpils, a \"black Pils,\" but, unlike a blond Pils, which can be assertively bitter, the hop bitterness in Schwarzbier is always gentle and subdued.\n\n\nIn a glass, Schwarzbier looks much like a British dark ale, but looks can be deceiving. Schwarzbier, unlike a British ale, has a clean lager taste that leaves next to no perception of fruitiness on the palate. Instead, Schwarzbier produces very mild, almost bittersweet, notes of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. Like most traditional German lagers, Schwarzbier has a malty middle, but the sweetness is never cloying or overpowering. The beer is moderately to well attenuated and the finish tends to be dry. Its alcohol level by volume is in the range of 4.5 to 5%, rarely higher. To accentuate the Schwarzbier's dark elegance and appealing head, always serve it in a tall, fluted or tulip-shaped glass.","ibu":83,"name":"MÃ¶nchshof Premium Schwarzbier","state":"Bayern"},{"abv":7,"address":"Glazentorenweg 11","city":"Erpe-Mere","coordinates":[50.9193,3.9666],"country":"Belgium","ibu":26,"name":"Jan de Lichte","state":"Oost-Vlaanderen"},{"abv":9.5,"address":"Chausse Brunehault 37","city":"Montignies-sur-Roc","coordinates":[50.3705,3.7263],"country":"Belgium","ibu":82,"name":"Grand Cru","state":"Hainaut"},{"abv":0.9379489297198151,"category":"North American Lager","city":"Sturgeon Bay","coordinates":[44.8342,-87.377],"country":"United States","ibu":82,"name":"Summer Wheat","state":"Wisconsin"},{"abv":4.835519044191444,"address":"7734 Terrace Avenue","category":"German Lager","city":"Middleton","coordinates":[43.0949,-89.5163],"country":"United States","ibu":58,"name":"Capital Dark Doppelbock","state":"Wisconsin","website":"http://www.capital-brewery.com/"},{"abv":8.069247146013286,"city":"De Pere","coordinates":[44.4489,-88.0604],"country":"United States","ibu":94,"name":"Smokey the Beer","state":"Wisconsin"},{"abv":6.78493439179539,"address":"233 North Water Street","city":"Milwaukee","coordinates":[43.0334,-87.9093],"country":"United States","ibu":96,"name":"Belgian Wit","state":"Wisconsin"},{"abv":10.607429142157581,"address":"740 North Plankinton Avenue","city":"Milwaukee","coordinates":[43.0399,-87.9117],"country":"United States","ibu":68,"name":"Belgian Trippel","state":"Wisconsin"},{"abv":0.5867150017874556,"category":"Other Style","city":"Kenosha","coordinates":[42.5847,-87.8212],"country":"United States","ibu":52,"name":"Cherry Ice","state":"Wisconsin"},{"abv":1.0625845614561702,"address":"233 North Water Street","city":"Milwaukee","coordinates":[43.0334,-87.9093],"country":"United States","ibu":31,"name":"Dark Belgian Wit","state":"Wisconsin"},{"abv":6.848781649275114,"address":"1035 Sterling Avenue","category":"Other Style","city":"Flossmoor","coordinates":[41.5433,-87.6789],"country":"United States","ibu":20,"name":"Chessie Cherry","state":"Illinois"},{"abv":5.5,"address":"24 North Pleasant Street","category":"North American Ale","city":"Amherst","coordinates":[42.3763,-72.5199],"country":"United States","description":"Golden pale ale, slightly hoppy.

It took four batches to get it just right. John used acidulated malts imported from Europe to get the crisp, lemony/apple flavor the McAleese Brothers wanted. The bottle label reflects the McAleese family heritage, puctures the Kells Irish Pub logo, and a traditional Irish flutist. \n\n\nThe first Kells Irish Pub opened in Seattle in October 1983 in Post Alley, above the historic Pike Place Market.

The taste predominates with a warm, roasty flavor, balanced out with a slightly dry finish. It's smooth but not cloying, with a warming belt of alcohol (5.6% ABV).\n\n\nAlthough winter ales predate history, they are believed to have their origin in the pagan celebrations of winter solstice. Later, when monasteries produced the local brew, winter ales were made each year to commemorate the birth of Christ. Back then, winter ales were brewed full-bodied as a source of nutrition for the upcoming winter months. Today, winter ales are typified by their seasonality, their rich, malty flavors and by their deep, dark coloration.\n\n\nGenerally available November-March, Weyerbacher Winter Ale is the perfect libation for a winter meal, with good friends, or beside a warm fire fending off a cold winter night.","ibu":21,"name":"Winter Ale","state":"Pennsylvania","website":"http://www.weyerbacher.com/"},{"abv":5.4000000954,"address":"50 N.

In England most of the beer is some kind of \"bitter\".  Bitter is a style that became popular in the late 1800's. The most famous examples are brewed in Burton on Trent.  This hard water gives these beer a pleasantly dry bitter finish, hence the name \"bitter.\"  A brewery usually brews several bitters of various alcohol strengths.  The lowest in alcohol (and usually flavor) is called \"bitter\" or \"ordinary bitter.\"  A step up in alcohol and hop character gives us \"best bitter\" or \"special bitter.\"  Finally a beer is made that is full of hop aroma and flavor, has a maltiness to match, and a generous amount of alcohol is called an \"extra special bitter\" or E.S.B.\n\n\nAlthough inspired by the British Ales  Ballast Point Calico Amber Ale uses distinctive American hops, which give not only the crisp bitterness to balance the malt, but also a hint of floral aroma.

They added Kenyan beans to the mix because of a strong citrus flavor that compliments the hops. Creating en environment akin a French press, the beans are combined with whole flower hops in the hopback, and the hot wort passes through the vessel on the way to fermentation giving Scratch #19 a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor. There is a silky quality to the mouthfeel and a citrus hop finsh coming from the Kenyan beans and hops.\n\n\nSome stories have twists, and unfortunately a faulty valve in the fermentation cellar led to a dramatic beer tragedy one afternoon in the brewery. Risking life and limb (while keeping his mouth open to sample the beer), a heroic brewery team member took the dive reconnecting the valve and saving about half the batch of Scratch #19.\n\n\nSo for your amusement (and our final relief), we give you a draft-only release of a third-take on a style that demands continued research for the Troegs Brewery staff.

Nine years ago, we began our quest to provide beer lovers with a worthy fruit beer, by rolling out Wild Raspberry Ale. Our mantra is that real fruit makes real beer, so we ferment Wild Raspberry Ale with hundreds of pounds of real red and black raspberries. We steadfastly refuse to fall prey to extracts and cheap syrups. Sure, squirting syrup into a keg of beer and rolling it around on the floor is easy, but the taste is...  fake! Over the past nine years, we have stayed true to our commitment to real fruit, no matter what the time, expense, or late season frosts have thrown our way. One year, Mother Nature delivered a late cold snap that was so severe, we had to pre-order 85% of the harvestable U.S. black raspberry crop, just to meet the demand for Wild Raspberry Ale.\n\n\nOur efforts do not go unrewarded â€“ Wild Raspberry Ale is a truly effervescent, ruby red ale that achieves the almost impossible balance between malted barley and tart raspberry fruitiness. Its naturally tart character makes Wild Raspberry the ultimate accompaniment to spicy Mexican food or on its own as a stand-alone session beer.","ibu":60,"name":"Wild Raspberry Ale","state":"Colorado","website":"http://www.greatdivide.com/"},{"abv":5.5,"address":"Cte Marie-Thrse 86","city":"Falmignoul","coordinates":[50.2024,4.8914],"country":"Belgium","ibu":38,"name":"Troublette","state":"Namur"},{"abv":14.018589636813136,"address":"871 Beatty Street","city":"Vancouver","coordinates":[49.2766,-123.115],"country":"Canada","ibu":25,"name":"Game Day","state":"British Columbia"},{"abv":1.4509139492798606,"address":"202 - 13018 80th Avenue","city":"Surrey","country":"Canada","ibu":9,"name":"Blonde Ale","state":"British Columbia"},{"abv":5.0999999046,"address":"Oberdorferstrae 9","city":"Dornbirn","coordinates":[47.4097,9.7514],"country":"Austria","ibu":6,"name":"Naturtrubes"},{"abv":8.31542346441924,"address":"1313 NW Marshall Street","category":"North American Ale","city":"Portland","coordinates":[45.5311,-122.685],"country":"United States","ibu":42,"name":"Beer Town Brown","state":"Oregon","website":"http://www.bridgeportbrew.com/"},{"abv":5.1999998093,"address":"5945 Prather Road","category":"North American Ale","city":"Centralia","coordinates":[46.7713,-123.007],"country":"United States","ibu":62,"name":"Danger Ale","state":"Washington"},{"abv":10.238915946312774,"category":"German Lager","city":"Munich","coordinates":[48.1391,11.5802],"country":"Germany","ibu":118,"name":"Hacker-Pschorr Original Oktoberfest","website":"http://www.paulaner.com/"},{"abv":4.648398704976322,"category":"North American Ale","city":"Watertown","coordinates":[43.1947,-88.729],"country":"United States","ibu":11,"name":"Stout","state":"Wisconsin"},{"abv":0.5075496900479737,"category":"North American Lager","city":"New York","coordinates":[40.7323,-73.9874],"country":"United States","ibu":13,"name":"Harvest Wheat Beer","state":"New York","website":"http://www.heartlandbrewery.com/"},{"abv":1.465968022348455,"address":"26 West Industrial Drive","city":"O'Fallon","coordinates":[38.8058,-90.7532],"country":"United States","ibu":80,"name":"Griesendiech Pilsner","state":"Missouri"},{"abv":5.006710242066364,"address":"2400 State Highway 69","category":"North American Ale","city":"New Glarus","coordinates":[42.8171,-89.6306],"country":"United States","ibu":0,"name":"Imperial Stout","state":"Wisconsin","website":"http://www.newglarusbrewing.com/"},{"abv":8.75,"address":"901 SW Simpson Avenue","category":"North American Ale","city":"Bend","coordinates":[44.0474,-121.323],"country":"United States","description":"HOP HENGE IMPERIAL IPA â€“ The Ultimate in Hop Innovation \n\n\nHop Henge Imperial IPA returns to the Bond Street Series line-up this April in extreme fashion. Staying true to the experimental nature of the series and the â€œnever settleâ€ philosophy of Deschutes, our brewers went back to the drawing board to create an amplified version of last yearâ€™s monument to hops.\n\n\nHead Brewer Brett Porter says, â€œThis is a truly exciting and groundbreaking beer. We reformulated everything about the hop recipe to give Hop Henge an extraordinary aroma and flavor similar to a fresh hop beer.â€ In addition to the Cascade and Centennial hops, Deschutes Brewery is experimenting with a hop variety so new that it has yet to be named.\n\n\nThe team here at Bend Public House recommends Hop Henge as the perfect accompaniment for a variety of spicy foods, so be sure to have a bottle handy next time you make a batch of hot wings and go for the five alarm award. The high-octane hoppiness is a wildly refreshing antidote to a wide array of hot foods.\n\n\nLimited Availability April through June.\n\n\nDonâ€™t miss this amazing hop experiment that is sure to leave your taste buds begging for more.\n\n\n-http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/Brews/Bond+Street+Series/default.aspx\n\n\nAvailable April through June.\n\n\nHop Henge I.P.A. was first brewed in 2006 as an agressive West Coast style I.P.A. In 2007, Hop Henge is going Imperial!  Several pounds of  Centennial, Cascade and Northern Brewer hops are in each barrel with a heavy dry-hop presence to top it off.  A blend of crystal, pale and caraston malts creates an overall biscuity characteristic that is dense and muscular, building the alcohol base to support the monstrous hop profile.\n\n\nLike the rest of the Bond Street Series, Hop Henge highlights the creativity and curiosity of our brewers.  Bolder than its English ancestors, with huge hops and a bitter finish, this IPA is no wallflower.\n\n\nAlcohol By Volume: 8.1%\n\n\t\n\n\nIBU 95\n\n\nWhen one of our brewers suggested we name our new IPA Hop Henge, he also came up with the idea of actually recreating Stonehenge, only with hop bales.  We were up for the challenge and even though the weather did not want to cooperate, we pulled it off and threw a party afterwards.\n\n\t\n\n\n\nphoto: chris mather\n\nRatings, Awards & Notables\n\n\nWorld's Best Strong Pale Ale (Imperial IPA)\n\n2007 World Beer Awards\n\n\nWorld's 50 Best Beers\n\n2006 International Beer Challenge\n\n\nGold Medal, 92 Points\n\n2006 World Beer Championships\n\n\nSilver Medal, India Pale Ale Category\n\n2006 Australian International Beer Awards\n\n\nModern Brewery Age, February 12, 2007\n\n5 out 5 stars \n\nHop Henge started its life as an India Pale Ale, but this year it was bumped up to â€œImperial IPAâ€ status, with a hefty dose of additional hops.\n\nâ€œThis one is lovely,â€ said taster Tom Conti. â€œThey got it just right.â€\n\nIt pours out a deep amber, with an appealing rocky head, and rich hop aroma wafting from the glass. â€œThey sure dosed it with a lot of hops...[thereâ€™s] a lot of hop bitterness in the taste,â€ one taster observed.\n\nIn addition to the Imperial-level hopping, Hop Henge also boasts Imperial-level alcohol content, with 8.1% a.b.v.\n\nThis was the top-rated beer during its tasting session, and tasters had to dig deep for new superlatives to describe it. â€œThis is a beautiful beer,â€ concluded taster Gregg Glaser. â€œFull of flavor and hops and malt and hops again.â€\n\nâ€œNot for the timid,â€ said taster Robert Lachman.\n\n\n-http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/BrewPub/OnTap/125352.aspx","ibu":80,"name":"Hop Henge Imperial IPA","state":"Oregon","website":"http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/"},{"abv":12.7325923393775,"address":"375 Water Street","category":"German Ale","city":"Vancouver","coordinates":[49.2849,-123.11],"country":"Canada","description":"Our Hefeweizen is a faithful version of the traditional Bavarian wheat beer.

Since taking over this mid-town establishment, the Pajaks added a â€œbeer & wine licenseâ€ and subsequently transformed the European-style cafÃ© into a beer-centric place to grab breakfast, lunch, dinner and all beers during, around and between these fabulous meals. \n\n\nThe cafe's beer menu is extensive and all-encompassing. The staff is knowledgeable and enthusiastic. And the beer pour is always rightâ€” temperature, glass, presentation. \n\n\nâ€œNo hops were harmed in the brewing of this beer.â€ \n\n\nGruit is an old styleâ€”one that incorporates spices, herbs and fruit but no hops. The latter detail makes this style very rare in modern times. CafÃ© Amsterdamâ€™s Gruit is dark, strong and interesting. This combination of pale and dark malts, sage, thyme, cinnamon, black peppercorn and fresh orange peel composes distinctive, substantial flavors that meld together wonderfully. And at 12% ABV, this cellar-friendly ale is ready to lay you down!
